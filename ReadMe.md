SQL Visualization
=====================
SQL Visualization enables backend developers by providing a hierarchical representation of SQL scripts. Visualizating query dependencies means faster development, better documentation, and maintainability. Currently, Java is used to parse SQL Statements and provide diagram nodes in XML. Next VBA is used to build the visualization in Microsoft Visio. Future versions will rely entirely on Java; not VBA and MS Visio.


## Requirements
- Microsoft Visio
