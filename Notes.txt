Trying to decide how to orchestrate frontend/backend.
	web app
	    - frontend and back-end built in Javascript, HTML, CSS
	    - backend (SQL parsing) built in Javascript, not sure if Javascript can parse SQL statements; perhaps there isn't an open-source library
	desktop tool
	    - frontend(client-side): Javascript, HTML, CSS	
	    - backend(server-side): Java
	hybrid
	    - frontend(client-side): Javascript, HTML, CSS
	    - backend(server-side): Java





ToDo
	- Change autoConShapes to connect two shapes with a straight line instead of a square line

Query class requirements
	- Query class stores dependant objects references

Building Hierarchy and Format
	1. Parse SQL and build query objects
 	2. Draw and connect query objects
		- Regardless of spacial formatting
	3. Apply spacial formatting
		A. Parse query object tree from top to bottom
		B. Storing each query node's cascading width
		C. Apply horizontal spacing according to each query node's cascading width
